#Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default. To prove this, we can print the thread information from both the signal sender and the signal receiver to verify they run in the same thread.

import threading
import django.dispatch

# Define a signal
my_signal = django.dispatch.Signal()

# Define a receiver function for the signal
def my_signal_receiver(sender, **kwargs):
    print(f"Receiver is running in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

# Connect the receiver to the signal
my_signal.connect(my_signal_receiver)

# Code to send the signal
def send_signal():
    print(f"Signal is sent from thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
    my_signal.send(sender=None)

# Test the signal in the main thread
if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_signal()

    # Now, let's simulate sending the signal from a different thread
    new_thread = threading.Thread(target=send_signal, name="NewThread")
    new_thread.start()
    new_thread.join()
